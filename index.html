                    Sealcoating is a process that is often overlooked, but it is an important part of asphalt maintenance. It helps to protect your asphalt from weathering and fading, and it can extend the life of your pavement. Here are some reasons why sealcoating is so important:

                    Sealcoating protects against weathering.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sun and the elements can take a toll on your asphalt, causing it to fade and crack. Sealcoating provides a barrier against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, as well as rain, snow, and ice. This protection can extend the life of your pavement and keep it looking newer for longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating can also improve the appearance of your asphalt, making it look freshly installed. A well-maintained parking lot or driveway can make a good impression on customers and clients, and add to the curb appeal of your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating is a relatively inexpensive way to protect your investment in asphalt paving. When properly applied, sealcoating will prolong the life of your pavement and save you money in the long run.

                        <p>
                            Fading is caused by exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays. Over time, these rays can break down the binders in asphalt that hold together the gravel and sand particles. This process causes the asphalt to become more brittle and prone to cracking. Sealcoating helps to prevent fading by blocking out UV rays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sealcoating can also help to prevent staining from gas, oil, and other fluids. When these fluids come into contact with asphalt, they can cause it to break down and stain. Sealcoating provides a barrier that helps to protect against staining.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to fading and staining, sealcoating can also help to prevent potholes from forming. Potholes are caused by the breakdown of <a href="http://asphaltolympiawa.com/why-is-asphalt-the-best-material-for-paved-surfaces/"
                    >asphalt due to water and ice seeping into cracks in the surface</a>. When the water freezes, it expands and causes the asphalt to crack and crumble. Sealcoating helps to fill in these cracks and prevent water and ice from seeping in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating is an important part of keeping your asphalt driveway or parking lot looking its best. It can help to prevent fading, staining, and potholes, and it helps to extend the life of your asphalt. When sealcoating is done properly, it can provide many years of protection for your investment.

                        Vehicles can cause wear and tear on asphalt surfaces over time. The weight of vehicles, as well as the friction of tires on the pavement, can lead to cracking and potholes. Sealcoating helps to resist this wear and tear by creating a harder surface that is more resistant to damage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sealcoating is a preventative measure that helps to extend the life of asphalt surfaces. By creating a harder, more durable surface, sealcoating can help protect against the formation of cracks and potholes. Sealcoating is also effective in resisting the wear and tear caused by vehicles over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sealcoating should be applied to new asphalt surfaces within six months of installation. For best results, sealcoating should be reapplied every two to three years.

                            Gasoline and other automotive fluids can cause damage to asphalt surfaces. These fluids can break down the binders in asphalt, leading to cracks and other problems. Sealcoating provides a barrier against these fluids, helping to protect your pavement from their damaging effects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sealcoating is also important for protecting asphalt surfaces from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. UV rays can break down the binders in asphalt, causing it to become brittle and more susceptible to damage. Sealcoating helps to reflect these UV rays away from the pavement, keeping it stronger for longer.
                        </p>

                    Regular sealcoating can help extend the life of your asphalt pavement by up to three times. This means that you’ll save money in the long run by not having to replace your pavement as often. It also means that you’ll have a smoother, better-looking surface for longer.

                    Sealcoating helps prevent water damage.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water can cause a variety of problems for asphalt pavements. It can seep into cracks and joints, causing them to widen and leading to potholes. In freezing weather, water can expand as it freezes, causing even more damage. Sealcoating helps to prevent water damage by creating a waterproof barrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating also protects against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which can dry out and break down asphalt. UV protection helps to extend the life of the pavement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these benefits, sealcoating gives asphalt a fresh, new look. A well-maintained parking lot or driveway makes a good impression on customers and clients.

                            Sealcoated surfaces provide better traction than uncoated pavement. This is especially important in areas that are prone to icy conditions in winter. The added traction can help to prevent accidents and injuries.

                        <p>
                            Sealcoating can also help to prolong the life of your pavement. The sealcoat material provides a barrier against the sun’s ultraviolet rays, which can cause asphalt to deteriorate over time. It also protects against water damage and erosion. By sealing your pavement, you can help it last longer and stay in better condition.

                <p>
                    When done properly, sealcoating can extend the life of your pavement and help to prevent costly repairs. In the long run, sealcoating is a very cost-effective way to maintain your asphalt surfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating can be performed by a professional contractor or you can do it yourself. If you decide to do it yourself, there are a few things you should know. First, it is important to clean the surface of your asphalt before applying the sealcoat. This will ensure that the sealcoat adheres properly and creates a barrier against the elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the surface is clean, you will need to mix the sealcoat according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once mixed, you will then need to apply the sealcoat with a brush or roller. Be sure to follow the directions on the label carefully so that you do not oversaturate the surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the sealcoat has been applied, you will need to allow it to dry completely before walking or driving on it. Depending on the temperature and humidity, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a full day. Once dry, your asphalt surface will be protected from the sun, snow, and rain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating is an important part of asphalt maintenance. It helps to protect your pavement from weathering, fading, and wear and tear. It also provides better traction and is cost-effective. If you have an asphalt surface, be sure to have it sealcoated regularly.
